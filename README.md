Dear reader, this game went through a lot of revisions and it has many trashed code and assets.
it has no comments so please don't waste that much time trying to understand it.
And I couldn't get the game to work in HTML5, maybe because the code wasn't designed for it and if yes, then it's your problem because you did not tell me before.
Build the game(exe) or check it out in the relases section yourself.
